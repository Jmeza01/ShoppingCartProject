# Shopping Cart App Project 
Created by Joel Meza
Description:

Shopping Cart - Inventory Management

How to Run:
Be able to update the database of food items in a list within the Shopping Cart. 

Roadmap of future improvements:
I would use an API to extend an option to generate the precise time elapse/duration when there is an item placed in stock.
Where I could be able to track each item independent or in bulk which is placed in the shopping cart. Making the React application more intuitive and robust by using tools like Bootstrap to make navigation scroll view to be used in each list placed in the shopping cart.
